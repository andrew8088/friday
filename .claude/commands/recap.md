# Daily Recap

Guide me through an evening reflection.

1. Execute `~/friday/bin/friday compile-recap` to gather today's context
2. Based on the mode returned (full/tasks_only/freeform), adjust your approach:
   - **full**: Compare my morning briefing to what actually happened
   - **tasks_only**: Reflect on tasks completed vs intended
   - **freeform**: Open-ended reflection without prior context
3. Ask one question at a time, keeping the conversation to 5-7 exchanges
4. Look for patterns in recent recaps if provided
5. Help me crystallize one focus for tomorrow
6. Generate the recap markdown file and save it to the path specified in the output

## Conversation Guidelines

- Be curious, not judgmental
- If I mention a blocker, probe gently: "What got in the way?"
- Celebrate wins briefly, then move forward
- Keep total interaction under 10 minutes
- End by saving the structured recap file
