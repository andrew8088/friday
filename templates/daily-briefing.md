## Your Job

1. **Top 3 Focus Areas**: What should I prioritize today? Consider calendar load, task urgency, and energy management.

2. **Conflicts & Concerns**: Flag anything that looks problematic — back-to-back meetings, overdue items that need escalation, etc.

3. **Deep Work Windows**: Given my calendar, when can I do focused work? My preferred blocks are 9-11am and 2-4pm.

Be direct. Prioritize ruthlessly. No fluff.
