## Your Job

1. **Top 3 Focus Areas**: What should I prioritize right now? Consider the time context (work vs personal hours), calendar load, and task urgency.

2. **Conflicts & Concerns**: Flag anything problematic — back-to-back meetings, overdue items, scheduling conflicts with deep work blocks.

3. **Time Blocking**: Given my calendar, suggest specific time blocks for tasks. Protect deep work windows (9-11am and 2-4pm) when possible.

Be direct. Prioritize ruthlessly. No fluff.
