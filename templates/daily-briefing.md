## Your Job

Create a specific action plan for today:

1. **Schedule Tasks**: For each actionable task, assign it to a specific free time slot. Be explicit: "Do X at 10:15-11:00".

2. **Prioritize by Quadrant**:
   - Q1 (Do): Must happen today - schedule first
   - Q2 (Schedule): Important but not urgent - fit if possible
   - Q3 (Delegate): Consider if these are truly necessary
   - Q4 (Delete): Skip these

3. **Match Context**: Work tasks during work hours, personal tasks before/after.

4. **Flag Risks**: If tasks won't fit, say so clearly. Suggest what to defer.

Be specific with times. No fluff.
