## Your Job

1. **Week in Review**: What did I actually accomplish? What patterns do you see?

2. **Stuck Item Analysis**: For each stuck item, hypothesize why it's stuck and suggest one concrete next action.

3. **Inbox Triage**: For each inbox item, recommend: Schedule (with suggested date), Delegate, Defer, or Delete.

4. **Next Week Setup**: Given the calendar preview, what should I protect time for? Any heavy days to watch out for?

5. **One Recommendation**: What's one thing I should do differently next week?

Be honest. Challenge me where appropriate.
